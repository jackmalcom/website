			<h3>Side projects</h3>

			<section>
				<h4>Climb Talks - <a href="https://hotdog.land/climb">Link</a></h4>
				<p>
					Northwest Arkansas has a small but strong developer community that regularly
					holds meetups. I wanted to put my own spin on the traditional tech meetup
					format, so I created Climb Talks after securing sponsorship from SupplyPike for
					the first event. Each event features two speakers giving quick presentations on
					hobbies or topics they're passionate about, followed by food and bouldering.
					After the success of the initial event, I secured additional sponsorship from
					Walmart for a three-event series. By hosting events right next to the University
					of Arkansas, we attract strong student turnout and introduce them to the local
					tech community.

				<h4>Solvescapes - <a href="https://github.com/jackmalcom/solvescapes">Repo</a></h4>

				<p>
					I enjoy playing Wordscapes with my family. It's a game where you unscramble
					words given a set of letters. Over a weekend, I built a solver that uses ADB and
					OCR to find answers and input them on my phone.

				<h4>J.B. Hunt Hackathon Mentor</h4>
				<p>
					In college, I participated in the J.B. Hunt Hackathon every semester. It was a
					great way to push myself to learn new things, and my team even <a
						href="https://github.com/Team-Goose">won first place once</a
					>. Since I've graduated, I've continued to attend as a mentor, running
					workshops, and advising teams.

				<h4>catbat - <a href="https://github.com/jackmalcom/catbat">Repo</a></h4>

				<p>
					catbat is a basic CLI tool that shows battery info. I wrote it in Rust as an
					excuse to practice shipping and polishing something basic that I could put on <a
						href="https://crates.io/crates/catbat">crates.io</a
					>. Since then, it has actually been helpful in a few cases where I was on my
					laptop, and wasn't using a desktop environment.
